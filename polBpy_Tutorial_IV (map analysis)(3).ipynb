    "# DISPERSION ANALYSIS II\n",
    "Author: Jordan Guerra (for Villanova University). May 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial illustrates the more advanced use of the package *polBpy* for performing angular dispersion analysis and studying the magnetoturbulent state of gas using dust polarimetric observations. Parameters determined with this anaylsis can be used for DCF calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses data from literature listed [here.](https://github.com/jorgueagui/polBpy/blob/9039d4af5d25c49130bf51be7fe0ce363424edcc/refs.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXAMPLE I**: This example shows how to perform local dispersion analysis for a region of dust/gas. This analysis follows these steps: 1) calculating the autocorrelation function of the polarized flux, and measuring its width as estimation of the cloud's depth; 2) calculating a pixel-by-pixel *dispersion function* by defining a circular kernel of radius $w$ centered at each pixel; 3) fitting the *dispersion functions* with the two-scale model of Houde+09 using a Markov-Chain Montecarlo (MCMC) approach and determining the magnetotubrulent parameters. We reproduce here some results from Guerra+21, which presents uses SOFIA/HAWC+ multiwavelength polarimetric observations of the OMC-1 region."

That is, fitting processes corresponding to different pixels can be sent to different cores (this process does not require communication between the different processes). Besdides the necessary inputs (dispersion function map, their uncertainties, $\\ell$ values, kernel size (in pixels), beam size (in arcsecs), we can provide initial-guess values for the parameters $a_{2}$, $\\delta$, and $\\Delta^{\\prime}/[\\langle B_{t}^{2}\\rangle/\\langle B_{0}^{2}\\rangle]$.

    "The MCMC solver sometimes provides solutions for pixels that are out-of-statistics for their inmediate region. See for example the value ~100 in the $\\a_{2}$ around the pixel (10,15). Therefore, we can \"clean\" the maps by performing a $\\sigma$ clipping. That is, each pixel value is compared to the statistics in a 3x3 pixels kernel aroudn it. If the value is outside the range $median \\pm n\\sigma$ then the value for the such pixel is interpolated from its nearest neighbors.\n",
